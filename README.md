### Testing
If you wish to help us improve the modpack: Play it [using Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/horizons)!

Then you can open an [Issue]([https://github.com/Blasto33/Horizons/pulls](https://github.com/Blasto33/Horizons/issues)https://github.com/Blasto33/Horizons/issues) to help us know what can be improved:
- A bug
- A block/item/mob with game-breaking mechanics
- Something you just don't like or feel like could be improved to help with the immersion

I currently didn't plan any automation to make the development faster since I'm the only one working on it. I will change this in the future if needed, provided the project get some interest.

#### Install the modpack through GitHub
It is still possible for you to use this repository to play the modpack. However, I wouldn't recommend to do so since I only uploaded it for my needs and things can be tedious. If you really want to play the modpack, check the project on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/horizons) for a clean setup.
